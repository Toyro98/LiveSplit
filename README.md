# LiveSplit
Autosplitters created by me

## Mirror's Edge 69 Stars 
Supports Steam, Origin, GoG, and Reloaded

Autosplits the moment when the amount of checkpoints you passed is equal to the total amount of checkpoints in the current time trial. 
Could also be used for custom time trials too. There were options before to split each timed checkpoint or every checkpoint. However, since it was unused, I removed it

Future version would check the total time it took you to complete the time trial and check if you beat the 3 star requirement before it splits. 
No more accidental 2 star on a time trial.
