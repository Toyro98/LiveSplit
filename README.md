I created this autosplitter when I was bored and messed around with Cheat Engine on Mirror's Edge. I noticed it stored an int after each time you touched a checkpoint. Then I started creating the autosplitter. With this, I hope there will be more runs in the 69 star category. Since now you don't have to manually split. Focus on the speedrun and not having to get ready to split manually :)
