# Livesplit.MirrorsEdge_69Stars
This isn't 100% perfect autosplitter but it works

To avoid any issues with the timer automatically starting without launching a time trial. Open liveslit after you started the game. When you're done doing attempts. Make sure to close livesplit first. Otherwise the timer will start once you closed the game
